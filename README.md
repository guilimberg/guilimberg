### Hi there, I'm [@guilimberg](https://github.com/guilimberg)ðŸŒ¿

I got a PhD in Astronomy/Astrophysics from [@usp](https://github.com/usp) and now I am a [KICP Postodoctoral Fellow](https://kavlicosmo.uchicago.edu/kicp-fellowship/) at [@uchicago](@uchicago).

I'm interested in most things Galactic Archaeology, including metal-poor stars, star clusters, stellar substructures (phase mixed, streams, and overdensities), and dwarf galaxies.

If you are looking for code/data used in any of [my 1st-author papers](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/public-libraries/5AgJmpNJQ-OgcvUhvd2uxQ), but **can't** find it here, get in touch! The complete analyses for some of my papers were fully coded in Google Collab, so I could even provide the actual notebooks.
