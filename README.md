### Hi there, I'm [@guilimberg](https://github.com/guilimberg) ðŸŒ¿

I'm an Astronomy final-year PhD student (or 'candidate' in the US terminology) at [@usp](https://github.com/usp).

I'm interested in most things Galactic Archaeology, including metal-poor stars, star clusters, stellar substructures, and dwarf galaxies.

During the 2022/2023 academic year, I'm staying at [@uchicago](https://github.com/uchicago) working within the Near-field Cosmology group led by Prof. [@alexji](https://github.com/alexji).

If you are looking for code/data used in any of [my 1st-author papers](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/search/p_=0&q=%20author%3A%22%5Elimberg%2C%20guilherme%22%20year%3A2021-2023&sort=date%20desc%2C%20bibcode%20desc), but **can't** find it here, get in touch! The complete analyses for some of my papers were fully coded in Google Collab, so I could even provide the actual notebooks.
